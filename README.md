# Overview
NewspaperWorks is a gem (Rails "engine") for [Hyrax](https://hyrax.samvera.org/) -based digital repository applications to support ingest, management, and display of digitized newspaper content.

NewspaperWorks is not a stand-alone application. It is designed to be integrated into a new or existing Hyrax (v2.5-v2.9.4) application, providing content models, ingest workflows, and feature-rich UX for newspaper repository use-cases.

NewspaperWorks supports:
* models for Title, Issue, Page, and Article
* batch ingest via command line
* OCR and ALTO creation
* newspaper-specific metadata fields
* full-text search
* calendar-based issue browsing
* advanced search
* OCR keyword match highlighting
* viewer with page navigation and deep zooming

A complete list of features can be found [here](https://github.com/samvera-labs/newspaper_works/wiki/Features-List).

## Documentation
A set of helpful documents to help you learn more and deploy NewspaperWorks can be found on the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/samvera-labs/newspaper_works/wiki), including a PCDM model diagram, metadata schema, batch ingest instructions, and more details on installing, developing, and testing the code.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/samvera-labs/newspaper_works/wiki/Installing,-Developing,-and-Testing) for more details on how to install and configure dependencies.

# Installation
NewspaperWorks easily integrates with your Hyrax 2.x applications.

* Add `gem 'newspaper_works'` to your Gemfile.
* Run `bundle install`
* Run `rails generate newspaper_works:install`
* Set config options as indicated below...

## Application/Site Specific Configuration

### Config changes made by the installer:
* In `app/controllers/catalog_controller.rb`, the `config.search_builder_class` is set to a new `CustomSearchBuiler` to support newspapers search features.
* Additional facet fields for newspaper metadata are added to `app/controllers/catalog_controller.rb`.
* Newspaper resource types added to `config/authorities/resource_types.yml`.

(It may be helpful to run `git diff` after installation to see all the changes made by the installer.)

### Configuration changes you should make after running the installer:

#### in config/intitializers/hyrax.rb:
* set `config.geonames_username`
  * Enables geolocation tagging of content
  * [how to create a Geonames username](http://www.geonames.org/login)
* set `config.work_requires_files = false`
* set `config.iiif_image_server = true`
* set `config.fits_path = /location/of/fits.sh`

#### in config/environments/production.rb:

* set `config.public_file_server.enabled = true`

# Ingesting Content

NewspaperWorks supports a range of different ingest workflows:
* single-item ingest via the UI
* batch ingest of [NDNP materials](https://github.com/samvera-labs/newspaper_works/wiki/NDNP-Batch-Ingest-Guide) (page-level digitization) via command line
* batch ingest of [PDF issues](https://github.com/samvera-labs/newspaper_works/wiki/PDF-Batch-Ingest-Guide) via command line
* batch ingest of [TIFF or JP2 master files](https://github.com/samvera-labs/newspaper_works/wiki/TIFF-or-JP2-Batch-Ingest-Guide) via command line

The ingest process creates a full complement of derivatives for each Page object, including:
* TIFF
* JP2
* PDF
* OCR text
* word-coordinate JSON

For more information on derivatives, see the [wiki](https://github.com/samvera-labs/newspaper_works/wiki/Image-Format-and-Derivative-Notes).

# Developing, Testing, and Contributing

Detailed information regarding development and testing environments setup and configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/samvera-labs/newspaper_works/wiki/Installing,-Developing,-and-Testing)

A Vagrant VM is available for users and developers to quickly and easily deploy the latest NewspaperWorks codebase using Vagrant and VirtualBox. See [samvera-newspapers-vagrant](https://github.com/samvera-labs/samvera-newspapers-vagrant) for more.

Additionally, the [NewspaperWorks Demo Site](https://newspaperworks.digitalnewspapers.org/) is available for those interested in testing out NewspaperWorks as deployed in a vanilla Hyrax application. (**NOTE:** The demo site may not be running the latest release of NewspaperWorks.)
